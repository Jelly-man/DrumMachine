# DrumMachine
A JS drum machine using querySelectors, Timeout and switchstatement. 

In this repo I used basic JS to select objects within the DOM and set eventListners for keydown and click. 
Additionally I used a for loop and switch statement along with setTimeout. 

Additionail infomration will be added to the readMe over time.
